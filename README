This is a blog application for use in Django projects.
The naming structure needs improvement.
There are Blog_Site objects, which represent a collection of blog entries, called "Blog" objects (should be "Entry").
Comments are also incorporated.
When a single blog is being viewed, comments and a comment form are visible. Simple commenting is allowed, with user-submitted username and email (optional) as well as a timestamp for submission time. No complex sign-ins are required for use (and therefore, no identity verification possible).
A blog may contain a single Gallery of Images.
A blog_site object has a special method called "month_as_table" - given a year and a month, it will return html coding for the month as a table, with blog-entry days linking to that days' entries. There are also clickable buttons to scroll between months.
Please see models.py for more info on the calendar table.
