This is a blog application for use in Django projects.
Presently it relies on the Calendar and Gallery applications I've also built, though this should be trivial to separate.
The naming structure needs improvement.
There are Blog_Site objects, which represent a collection of blog entries, called "Blog" objects (should be "Entry").
Comments are also incorporated.
When a single blog is being viewed, comments and a comment form are visible. Simple commenting is allowed, with user-submitted username and email (optional) as well as a timestamp for submission time. No complex sign-ins are required for use (and therefore, no identity verification possible).
A blog may contain a single Gallery of Images.
